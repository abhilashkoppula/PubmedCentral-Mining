conspicuous singing may be risky and previous research has found that individuals trade off singing performance with song perch exposure we studied the relationship between predation risk (degree of concealment height in tree or shrub and distance to the forest edge) and time allocated to singing and vigilance in a group of 13 passerine species living in an east african savanna concealed birds sang more and were less vigilant vigilance increased as distance to the forested edge increased but distance had no effect on time allocated to singing body size was significantly correlated with vigilance but not singing; larger passerines were more sensitive to both relative concealment and the distance to the forest edge while song was influenced by neither of these factors perch height had no effect on either behavior our results suggest that birds modify vigilance and to some extent singing behavior to minimize their exposure to predators',null,100000000),(21874090,,'The role of

importance we conducted two experiments to study the foraging decisions of white-browed sparrow-weavers (plocepasser mahali) the first experiment manipulated both direct and indirect cues in a feeding array by simultaneously placing feeding stations at different distances from humans (to manipulate direct risk) and from protective cover (to manipulate indirect risk) weaver foraging was influenced more by indirect risk than by direct risk the second experiment aimed to determine if weaver’s indirect risk assessment was sensitive to variation in benefits we set two feeding stations at different distances from cover but the same distance from the human observers and systematically increased the amount of food at the station farther from cover weavers far from cover initially foraged at higher rates than those close to cover but the addition of food reduced the foraging rate together our results illustrate that weaver foraging decisions are sensitive to variation in risk and that indirect

rates of their single chick by regurgitating larger meals we tested whether acoustic parameters of begging call elements may also be involved in signalling to describe variation in begging we determined begging session parameters namely the duration number of calls and the mean and maximum rate of calling we then digitised calls and carried out a semi-automatic extraction of six acoustic parameters of call elements including mean and maximum acoustic frequency the length of call elements and the location of the maximum frequency and amplitude within calls chicks showed strong individual differences in all parameters while the session parameters were correlated with body condition and with the meal size the chick received none of the acoustic parameters were related to body condition and provisioning a cross-fostering experiment showed the same pattern as only session parameters changed related to an experimentally altered body condition while acoustical cues appear to play no role in signalling hunger levels we suggest that this may be explained by the absence of sibling competition in these birds as parents do not need to decide which chick to feed immediate

development we examined the localization of the glucocorticoid receptor in the small intestine microscopic analysis showed that growth of villi and crypts is age-dependent and is significantly attenuated in adx rats compared with sham-operated rats brdu-positive cells ie proliferating cells were primarily observed in crypt compartments and rapidly increased in number during the early

of internal ca2+ store the spironolactone-induced [ca2+]i dynamics was slightly inhibited therefore the spironolactone-induced dynamics of [ca2+]i can be caused by either a ca2+ influx from extracellular fluid or ca2+ mobilization from internal ca2+ store with the former being dominant as tetraethylammonium an inhibitor of the k+ channel slightly inhibited the spironolactone-induced

the immunoreactivity of lat1 was predominantly observed in the supranuclear cytplasmic localization with a granular or dot-like staining pattern up to 8–9 weeks gestation the immunoreactivity of 4f2hc

immunohistologically in 26 specimens of oral lesions including benign disease (hyperplasia papilloma and others) intraepithelial neoplasia/borderline disease (dysplasia) and malignant disease (cis

the metaphase plate in this study we further clarified the mechanism underlying asura function on chromosome congression interestingly asura is not specifically localized at the kinetochore during mitotic phase unlike other kinetochore proteins which construct the kinetochore electron microscopy (em) observation showed that asura is required for proper kinetochore formation by the partial depletion of asura kinetochore maturation is impaired and kinetochores showing fibrillar balls without a well-defined outer plates are often observed moreover even when the outer plates of kinetochores are constructed most showed structures stretched and/or distended from the centromere which resembled premature kinetochores at prometaphase indicating that the constructed kinetochore plates are less rigid against tension derived from kinetochore microtubule pulling forces we concluded that asura is an essential protein for complete kinetochore development although asura is not

mouse lack granular ducts which express klotho in wild type mice suggesting that klotho may be a gene responsible for granular duct development although aging resulted in growth suppression of myoepithelial cells because of the sparse distribution of the cells in kl/kl mouse salivary glands the expression of podoplanin and e-cadherin was shown in aging myoepithelial cells it is thought that podoplanin participates in the actin-e-cadherin networks which are maintained in aging myoepithelial cells it was also shown that granular ducts were filled with p-cadherin and that the p-cadherin amount was larger in the wild type mouse submandibular glands than in the sublingual and parotid glands of wild type mouse and in the submandibular glands of kl/kl mouse these findings suggest that

(cortisol in humans or corticosterone in rodents) exert numerous effects on the central nervous system that regulates the stress response mood learning and memory and various neuroendocrine functions corticosterone (cort) actions in the brain are mediated via two receptor systems: the glucocorticoid receptor (gr) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (mr) it has been shown that gr and mr are highly colocalized in the hippocampus these receptors are mainly distributed in the cytoplasm without hormones and translocated into the nucleus after treatment with hormones to act as transcriptional factors thus the subcellular dynamics of both receptors are one of the most important issues given the differential action of mr and gr in the central nervous system it is of great consequence to clarify how these receptors are trafficked between cytoplasm and nucleus and their interactions are regulated by hormones and/or other molecules to exert their transcriptional activity in this review we focus on the nucleocytoplasmic and subnuclear trafficking of gr and mr in neural cells and non-neural cells analyzed by using molecular imaging techniques with green fluorescent protein (gfp)

young cells derived from atll stem cells the heating-ar and ultra-ihc detected physiological expression of the p53 protein and its probable phosphorylation by tax in peripheral blood mononuclear cells

e2f-4 dp-1 and cyclin e) in atll and peripheral t-cell lymphoma cells the ultra-ihc with ar is useful for etiological pathological diagnosis of atll since htlv-1 pathogenicity depends on that of tax

reactivity being stronger in serous cells in addition immunoreactivity for bdnf was observed in the saliva matrix of ductal cavities western blotting detected one significant immunoreactive 14 kda band in the hsg and saliva immunoreactivities for salivary bdnf measured by elisa in humans were 4076±483 pg/ml and 5264±842 pg/ml in men and women respectively although salivary bdnf concentrations
